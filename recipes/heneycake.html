      <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar, divided</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>¼ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        step 1: Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a
        simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook
        for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.
      </li>
      <li>
        step 2: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and
        flour a 9-inch square baking pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        step 3: Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in
        a bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        step 4: Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl
        until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour
        mixture, alternating with milk, beating just until incorporated; stir in
        walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        step 5: Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into
        center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        step 6: Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a
        toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup over cake. For best
        results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup
        before slicing and serving.

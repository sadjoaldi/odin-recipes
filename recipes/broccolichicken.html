    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A deliciously creamy chicken, broccoli, and stuffing casserole with
      shredded chicken and tender broccoli in a cheesy mushroom sauce. Use your
      favorite stuffing mix to sprinkle over top for a crunchy, flavorful
      topping. Use leftover chicken or turkey to speed up prep time even more.
